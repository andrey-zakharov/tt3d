Map is huge. Player can zoomout to scheme view, which should be simple enough to be calculated for very large areas.
Size of zoomed in area can be determinated by player's system power (via game settings) and include well made simulating mode.

tracks should be planned, price can be calculated (dynamic) based on construction companies activities in this region.
Anyways, each track cell (or 100m of it) can have several owners (shares). Such can be done at planning stage (another player
do the same plan, and players shares the building costs and after do not pay each other passing fee

industries types initially loaded from def files. After creation of world, last one contains an economy object,
which contains industries, cities, .... Initials routes should be established between industries to init them. <-


Trains has power, and TE (Tractive Effort) and aero resist. There are two situations where works on maximum -
    start moment and moving(climbing).
Sometimes they can be at the same time. While starting, train needs to overcome friction of train weight.
While moving - aero resist (proportional speed), when climbing - wagons weight (kinetic energy become potential energy)
Each body have a impulse = m * v (m-mass, v-velocity), which resist to changes. So, each train should be accelerated
and slow down with this point.


Track and roads should be builded in a free form. User clicks start, moves mouse, and clicks at the end.
Plan of build been created. User can adjust while in planning state
